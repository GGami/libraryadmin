> The Saint Louis University Library is planning to integrate an on-line
reservation and borrowing system that will allow members of the faculty,
students, and administration personnel to:

> Access the system (with the provisions that it is compatible with any
operating system) using mobile phones, net books, laptops, tablets or
any electronic gadget or device that can be connected to the Internet.
Search for books, articles, journals, CDs and other related reading or
research materials that are available in the library.
Reserve and borrow the said materials on-line via a website that is
hosted by the IT Center and managed by the University’s library
personnel.

> You were asked to initially analyze the system given some provisions and to
submit the following deliverables:

 Procedures, policies, and guidelines that the users will conform to in
accessing, searching, reserving, and borrowing the materials online.

 The user interfaces’ (UI) design to illustrate how the users can access
and navigate the system. Only a prototype is needed and any tool can be
used to design the interface. A paper prototype (drawings on paper) may
also be considered.

 The provisions imposed by the library regarding the duration of borrowed
books will hold. (Please refer to the Library Policies and Guidelines
manual.)

 Sample forms and/or receipts that are needed to be filled-out or printed
to initiate or finalize the processes that will take place.
